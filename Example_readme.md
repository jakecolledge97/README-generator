## User Story

```
AS somone looking to relax with a good movie/tv show
I WANT an easy way to choose the finest of movies and tv shows
SO THAT I can spend more time watching and less time choosing.
```

## Description
moodvies takes the hassle out of choosing something to watch by picking a selection of movies and tv for the user, based on their current mood. 

When the user goes into the application they are greeted with different emojis to choose from based on how they are feeling or how they want to feel. By clicking on an emoji they are then presented with a selection from the top 250 film and tv shows that would be best suited to how they are feeling. 

If the user is not sure what their mood is, we have an emoji for 'meh' wherein we choose random genres for them to look at!


## Motivation
moodvies was created to overcome the problem of too much choice! We, as a team, want the user to be able to find something great to watch in a fun and simple way that wont cost them too much time and effort.


## Mockup
moodvies is a responsive application styled using the CSS framework Materialise and uses film data provided by the third party API's OMDB and IMDB. 

As a team, we decided to stick with a minimalist approach to the appearance of our app and used blue tones with a dash of fluro to make it look more sleek.

## Final Comments
Looking towards the future, we would love to expand our app to also include music suggestions for the user to choose from.
